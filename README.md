- 👋 Hi, I’m @BanjoBatman
- 👀 I’m interested in Guitars, Mandolins, Banjos, and any other instruments really. Also, I enjoy programming in most C like languages (C#, C++, Java, TypeScript, etc.). I also like microcontrollers and have several projects running in my house using both Ardiuno and ESP8266 platforms. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mongo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really. Just want to share some things. 
- 📫 How to reach me: banjobatman@gmail.com
